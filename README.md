# The Passive Record Challenge

The challenge is simple:

1. Clone the repository on the `main` branch
1. From the project's root directory, run:
    ```sh
    $ rspec --fail-fast
    ```
1. Add code to [`passive_record.rb`](https://github.com/amcaplan/passive_record/blob/main/passive_record.rb) to make the tests pass
1. Run with the `DEBUG` flag to see what reaches the database:
    ```sh
    $ DEBUG=true rspec --fail-fast
    ```
1. Stuck? Check the [`solution`](https://github.com/amcaplan/passive_record/tree/solution) branch for one potential solution

Good luck!
